If you want to create a project using ES6 full features (including module export/import), 
with SCSS and Bootstrap 4, with image optimization, this project maybe the best solution for you. 

The project has the following features:

 - Compilation of ES6 into ES5
 - Converting SASS into CSS
 - Bootstrap 4
 - Image loading and optimization
 - Webpack dev server
 - HMR for hot reloading and faster development
 - Font loading
 - Fontawesome loading (only free - solid and brand)
 
#### The project is production ready.
 
## Installation
1. Clone the project
2. Go to the project root directory
3. Run `npm install`

## Running on development using [dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)

Run `npm run start:dev` to start to webpack dev server with HMR ready

## For production 

Run `npm run build` to build project's all assets in `dist` folder.

## Starting a new project
There's a site implemented (minimo) as an example.
1. remove the whole body tag from the index.html file in the src folder.
2. In src/scss/app/main.scss remove all tags to the bottom starting from the body tag.

That's it happy coding!
